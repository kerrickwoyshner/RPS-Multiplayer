# RPS-Multiplayer

This application is an online multiplayer version of rock, paper, scissors - webchat included!

You and your opponent can face off on different screens with this app, taking turns selecting your move as you enter quick, witty banter in the chat.

The application will tally up your wins and losses, but make sure to keep a running chart of your own back home - you'll want to keep playing this one over and over.
